# Problem
HighBloodPressure , how can i have an app that help people eat better , educate them and point them in the right direction at the cheapest price?

1. Start Tracking your blood Pressure
# Use Apple Health 
Tracking Blood Pressure

2. Maintaining a food diary! 
Use a app that snap a photo and it breaks down the calorie count as well the macro nutrients and if it good or bad for high blood pressure, allow u to do food swaps!

Allows people to share with ur nutritionist coach
